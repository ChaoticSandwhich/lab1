		<h1>How expensive is a full space suite from NASA?</h1> 
		<h2>by Kevin Castaneda </h2>
		<p>
			Back in 1974, NASA revealed that a spacesuit cost between $15-22 million,
            which comes out to about $83-122 million today.

            according to The Space Store

        <h1> Why is it so expenive?</h1>
		<h2>here are some reasons</h2>
		<p>
			1. Advanced Technology: Space suits are equipped with various systems to provide life support, temperature control, 
			pressure regulation, communication, and more. Developing and incorporating these advanced technologies requires extensive research, 
			development, and testing, which can be expensive.
		</p>
		<p> 
			2. Customization and Fit: Each astronaut requires a custom-fitted space suit to ensure a proper seal and comfortable fit.
			 Achieving this level of customization involves precision measurements and tailor-made components, which adds to the overall cost.
		</p>
		<p> 
			3. Safety and Reliability: Space travel is inherently risky, and space suits need to be extremely reliable to ensure astronaut safety. 
			Extensive testing and quality control are necessary to meet the rigorous safety standards, which contributes to the cost.
